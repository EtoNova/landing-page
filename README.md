# Boardgames Landing Page
This project is part of my HTML and CSS learning journey through The Odin Project. The goal was to recreate a common landing page layout and customize it to reflect my own style and interests, with a focus on board games.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview
The website consists of four main sections and a footer. I used Flexbox to create a clean layout and smooth content flow. The Flexbox structure helps ensure that the page remains visually appealing and readable across different screen sizes.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Building a complete landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS
- Recreating a design from a reference and customizing it
- Using Flexbox for layout and responsiveness
- Improving visual flow and design consistency
